# First Steps

___**Important:**___ ___You should have experience with JSON files and Git source code management.___

You need a Git tool like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and an editor that can work with JSON (we recommend  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

Clone the ArmyPlanner repository [`https://github.com/lk-code/armyplanner`](https://github.com/lk-code/armyplanner) with the Git tool and create a branch under which you keep the changes. After the desired changes are completed, the branch must be returned to the `main` branch by a pull request. This pull request must be approved by the ArmyPlanner team. Only then are the changes publicly available and can be used, for example, by the ArmyPlanner apps.<br />
