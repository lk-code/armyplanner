# First Steps

Use a tool like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone the repository [`https://github.com/lk-code/armyplanner`](https://github.com/lk-code/armyplanner). In the cloned repository, the files for games and codices can be edited. After each change, they must be committed to the ArmyPlanner GitHub repository via a pull request. This pull request must be approved by the ArmyPlanner team. Only then are the changes publicly available and can be used, for example, by the ArmyPlanner apps.
