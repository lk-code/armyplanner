# Getting Started

You can develop your own app and use the ArmyPlanner data. There is a ready-made library for this purpose:

[ArmyPlanner for .NET Projects (via NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ArmyPlanner)

[![Build](https://github.com/lk-code/armyplanner-core/actions/workflows/net-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lk-code/armyplanner-core/actions/workflows/net-build.yml)

### setup your project

1. add the nuget: <br />
`PM> Install-Package ArmyPlanner`

2. add the ArmyPlanner Services (via Dipendency Injection)<br />
`using ArmyPlanner.Extensions;`<br />
`...`<br />
`IServiceCollection services = ....`<br />
`services.AddArmyPlanner();`

3. ArmyPlanner services store data locally on a device storage. For this, a path must be specified by the developer. There is an internal app path (to store the repository data) and a public path for the user (to store the roster files)<br />
`// set app paths`<br />
`APP_DOCUMENTS_PATH = $"{Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments)}{Path.DirectorySeparatorChar}{DIRECTORY_APP_NAME}";`<br />
`APP_LOCAL_PATH = FileSystem.Current.AppDataDirectory; // on .NET MAUI`<br />
`APP_LOCAL_PATH = ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder.Path; // on UWP`<br />
` `<br />
`// CodexService`<br />
`ICodexService codexService = App.Services.GetService<ICodexService>();`<br />
`codexService.SetBasePathForCodexData(APP_LOCAL_PATH);`<br />
` `<br />
`// RepositoryService`<br />
`IRepositoryService repositoryService = App.Services.GetService<IRepositoryService>();`<br />
`repositoryService.SetBasePathForData(APP_LOCAL_PATH);`<br />
` `<br />
`// RosterService`<br />
`IRosterService rosterService = App.Services.GetService<IRosterService>();`<br />
`rosterService.SetBasePathForRosterData(APP_DOCUMENTS_PATH);`<br />

4. Now you can work with ArmyPlanner platform ðŸ˜Š
